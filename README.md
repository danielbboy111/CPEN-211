# CPEN-211
CPEN 211: Computing Systems I

Boolean algebra; combinational and sequential circuits; organization and operation of microcomputers, memory addressing modes, representation of information, instruction sets, machine and assembly language programming, systems programs, I/O structures, I/O interfacing and I/O programming, introduction to digital system design using microcomputers.

Throughout the course, I used Verilog to design digital circuits, Quartus to synthesize and implement them, and the DE1-SoC FPGA board to deploy, test, and demonstrate the designs.

Lab 3: Digital Lock using Combintional and Finite State Machine using Verilog

Lab 4: Binary Search using ARM Assembly Language

Lab 5: Datapath of the "Simple RISC Machine" using Verilog

Lab 6: Finite State Machine Controller for the “Simple RISC Machine”

Lab 7: Adding Memory and I/O to the “Simple RISC Machine”
